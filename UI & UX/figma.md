# what is figma?

**Figma** is a cloud-based **design tool** for interface design that is more useful for **team colloboration** helping designers and teams work together efficiently.

## Where it works?
Figma works on any operating system that runs a web browser. Macs, Windows PCs, Linux machines, and even Chromebooks can be used with Figma. It is the only design tool of its type that does this, and in shops that use hardware running different operating systems, everyone can still share, open, and edit Figma files. It also offers a web API, and it’s free!

## Where we use Figma?
Figma is a design tool that lets you create designs for mobile, web interfaces, logos, or any other kind of design you can think of.

We’ll also use Figma’s prototyping functionality to link the screens together, meaning that you can experience how the screens will behave when they’re built as an app.

## Collaboration in figma
As, Figma is a browser based design software (so teams can collaborate here as we do in google docs, google slides). People viewing and editing a file are shown in the top of the app as circular avatars. Each person also has a named cursor, so tracking who is doing what is easy. Clicking on someone else’s avatar zooms to what they are viewing at that time.

Using Figma, a design lead can check in to see what the team is designing in real time by simply opening a shared file. If a designer somehow misinterprets the brief or user story, this feature allows the design lead to intervene, correct course, and save countless hours that would have otherwise been wasted. 

Figma uses Slack as its communication channel. When a Figma channel is created in Slack, any comments or design edits made in Figma are “slacked” to the team. This functionality is crucial when designing live because changes to a Figma file will update every other instance where the file is embedded.

Figma also allows permissions-based sharing of any file, page, or frame. When a share link is created to a frame on a page, the person clicking on that link will open a browser version of Figma, and a zoomed-in view of the frame is loaded.



## How to use Figma?

**1. Set up your Figma account**
Getting started in Figma is as simple as going to www.figma.com, clicking “Sign up”, and entering your details. Once you’ve done that, Figma will open up with a start screen like this. Click on “New File” and we’ll get started!
As shown in the below picture.

**2. Create a frame**
Press F to select the Frame Tool. Alternatively, you can click the Frame Tool icon in the Options panel at the top of the window. Equally, if you’re used to Sketch, you can also hit A (for “Artboard”).

**3. Practise some specific keys to move around the canvas**
-The standard zoom commands are accessed with ⌘+ and ⌘-. 
-Shift ⇧2 will zoom to the current selection.
-Shift ⇧1 will zoom to show the whole canvas.
-N will zoom to the next Frame.
-Shift ⇧N will zoom to the previous Frame.
-Try pressing spacebar and you’ll see a hand icon pop up. Click and drag to move the whole canvas around. If you’re working with a Mac trackpad, you can do the same by dragging on the trackpad with two fingers.
-Hit Escape to exit from any tool.

**You can also access Arrange tools using keyboard shortcuts:**

Mac:

-⌘]: bring forward
-⌘Opt]: bring to front
-⌘[: send backward
-⌘Opt[: send to back
PC:
