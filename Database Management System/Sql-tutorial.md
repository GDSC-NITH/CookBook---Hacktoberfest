# What is SQL 

SQL is a database computer language designed for the retrieval and management of data in a relational database.
SQL stands for Structured Query Language.


## Why to Learn SQL?

SQL is Structured Query Language, which is a computer language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data stored in a relational database.
SQL is the standard language for Relational Database System.
All the Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, 
Postgres and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.

Also, they are using different dialects, such as −

1. MS SQL Server using T-SQL,
2. Oracle using PL/SQL,
3. Oracle using PL/SQL,



## Applications of SQL

1. Allows users to access data in the relational database management systems.

2. Allows users to describe the data.

3. Allows users to define the data in a database and manipulate that data.

4. Allows to embed within other languages using SQL modules, libraries & pre-compilers.

5. Allows users to create and drop databases and tables.

6. Allows users to create view, stored procedure, functions in a database.

7. Allows users to set permissions on tables, procedures and views.



## A Brief History of SQL

1. 1970 − Dr. Edgar F. "Ted" Codd of IBM is known as the father of relational databases. He described a relational model for databases.

2. 1974 − Structured Query Language appeared.

3. 1978 − IBM worked to develop Codd's ideas and released a product named System/R.

4. 1986 − IBM developed the first prototype of relational database and standardized by ANSI. 
          The first relational database was released by Relational Software which later came to be known as Oracle.
