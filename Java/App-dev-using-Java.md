# Master the basics

It’s pretty essential to have a solid foundation and grasp the fundamentals of Java if you want to be a successful developer in this language. 
Understanding the fundamentals helps learn more advanced skills and develop and establish new ones in the future. 
Although the Java language isn’t particularly complex to learn, going in as a beginner and seeing all the code can be daunting.

# Practice, practice, practice

Everyone can improve from practice, regardless of skill level or technical knowledge. 
You must practice programming and understand the fundamentals if you wish to be a successful Java developer. 
Programming helps you improve your problem-solving capabilities and prepare you for the real world by practicing. 
You may learn Java programming language from the comfort of your own home.

# Learn Java 8‍

Java 8 was designed to address some of the problems with Java 7 and prior versions. 
Because the language has been in existence since the 1990s, it required some modifications. 
Overall, Java 8 has improved the language in several ways. It’s more reliable, efficient, and a better competitor against others than it was before.

## Java 8 advantages include the following:

1. Easier to use
2. Security
3. Productivity
4. Better performance
5. Polyglot programming


# Limit string size

Optimize rows to prevent memory loss. 
This will ultimately allow your project to operate more quickly and efficiently. 
Strings may get long and take up unnecessary space, which might be used for more useful features.


# Periodically check code‍

It’s critical to the success of any project. 
Checking for bugs and correcting errors can be time-consuming and laborious. 
The good news is that other developers have recognized how tedious it is to review code, so they’ve developed tools to help with the process.
However, you may catch bugs quickly by utilizing Stack Trace or Null Pointer Exception.


# Use microservices and cloud

With microservices rapidly becoming the de facto architecture for cloud-based apps, understanding the microservice architecture is more important than ever.


# Learn Java libraries and APIs

To become a successful Java developer in application development, you need to understand the entire Java ecosystem. 
It’s not essential to be an expert on every little aspect of Java, but understanding the APIs and libraries can assist you in grasping the Java ecosystem. 
Though there are many more, having a basic understanding of these APIs and libraries will get you started:

1. Unit testing libraries, such as JUnit and Mockito
2. JSON processing APIs, such as Gson and Jackson
3. XML processing APIs, such as Xerces and JAXB
